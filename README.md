To run the example Flask application with JavaScript, follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Python Packages:**
   Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory, and run the following command to install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install flask openai
   ```

2. **Obtain an OpenAI API Key:**
   You need to have an OpenAI API key to use GPT-3. If you don't have one, you can sign up on the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/signup/) and obtain your API key.

3. **Update the Flask Application (`app.py`):**
   Replace `'your_openai_api_key'` in the `openai.api_key` line with your actual OpenAI API key.

4. **Save the Files:**
   Save the modified `app.py` and `templates/index.html` files in your project directory.

5. **Run the Flask Application:**
   In the terminal or command prompt, run the following command to start the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Access the Application:**
   Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see the "Article Generator" web page.

7. **Generate an Article:**
   - Enter a prompt in the text area.
   - Click the "Generate Article" button.

8. **View the Generated Article:**
   The generated prompt and article will be displayed on the same page without a full page reload.

Remember to keep your OpenAI API key secure and do not share it publicly. This example assumes you have Python and pip installed on your system. If you encounter any issues, make sure to troubleshoot based on error messages and Python environment configurations.
